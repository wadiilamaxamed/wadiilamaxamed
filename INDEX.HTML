                The act of hearing a language can help strengthen your comprehension. While it might take a few months of learning before you can understand 
                podcasts with native English speakers, there are plenty of podcasts available just for language learners Some examples include All Ears English
                Better at English, The English We Speak,Lukes English Podcast, and ESL Podcast. You can also use podcasts by speakers whose primary language is
                English simply for practice. Listen as white noise first, then play the episode a second time and see what new words you recognize.
                You can also read the episodes transcript as you listen if there one available, repeating sentences and words out loud. This can help you pick
                up new vocabulary and grammar more quickly, and you can set it to play at a slower speed.
                Getting as much speaking practice as possible is essential to quicker learning. If youre just swiping through a few levels on a language-learning app at night, youl be shocked when you finally come face-to-face with an English speaker.
                Without conversing in English, you wont be able to identify your weak spots. Finding a conversation partner, or even a study partner, who can augment your learning with real, live, face-to-face practice will allow you to put your fledgling skills to the test.
                Taking an online course is a great way to study the basics of English. Having this type of foundational knowledge will be fundamental to your comprehension and practice. Plus, you can choose the course based on your goals and current skill level. If you are hoping
                to learn conversational English for an upcoming trip, you can find a course thats tailored to this specific goal. There are also courses in English for international business, for writing, for reading, among many others. Depending on your end goal, enrolling in a 
                course that aligns with your objectives can set you on the path to success. 
                Many people say that speaking English regularly helps it stick in your head far better than reading or writing. After all, whats the point of learning a new language if not to use it to communicate? 
                Language-learning software programs like Rosetta Stone have been helping people learn English for years. Other technologies have also been made available that are designed to help users increase their knowledge or maintain their English proficiency. There are many 
                different types of technology that you can choose based on how you learn best. For example, Fluenz is a popular software that teaches through instructor-led videos, while Duolingo is an app you can use on your smartphone for daily, on-the-go practice.
                Grammarly Premium can also be a valuable tool to help you write in English with fluencyâ€”it includes suggestions specifically around grammar rules and idioms that are difficult to grasp. What more, users whose primary language is Spanish, Hindi, Mandarin, French,
                or German can find suggestions tailored to those languages.
